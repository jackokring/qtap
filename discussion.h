 * MASTERMAP - A mechanism for Turing Machine Computation in AI?
 * -------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * There are not enough operations? Stimulus is ill-defined? Feedback not made?
 *
 * It's not a full machine, but it is perhaps an implementation of an essential
 * feature, which is associative memory for similarity of stimulus and sequencing
 * of resulting actions based on the stimulus. The stimulus is perhaps partialy
 * filtered to make a subset for focused operation. A kind of stimulus mask
 * gobo triggered by a K value action control signal.
 *
 * The K value controlling a general route matrix (or an encasulated pointer to
 * a control matrix) approximates a convolve selection of the stimulus pre-hash
 * to be instructed upon producing an eventual K action after functional morph.
 *
 * The K (kinetic) is in control, while the T (sampled potential) is quite
 * static apart from time done to it. K is applied to T as in K(T) producing
 * a series of K_x(T) = T. This is the feedback loop of sychronous logic
 * with the data stored in QList<K>, in active form, as even passive is a Halt,
 * H, where as there is no passive T which is an applicator to make a K action.
 *
 * I could go on about a sub-speed of light that almost everything but K action
 * has ((K - H) < K) and the randomness of K option generation by keyHook()
 * removals or reassignment of the QList<K> for a T.
 *
 * It maybe possible to do a FoolMap<T, int(K)> -> _FoolMap<int(K), K> as an
 * alternate, and the datasize would be different along with the certainty and
 * determinancy of "mind" for such robotic uses.
 *
 * The K procesing from the empty K from a non map has to have a defult K,
 * to avoid H, and the H in the execution of K should be considered a kind of
 * process yeild to another thread, as H is a state of "death of the mind" to
 * be avoided. The halting problem inverts therefore to a free time engrossing
 * growing obsession with unfiltering T and motivation discovery of possible K.
